   - Example: "Young girl with wild red curls in a bright blue dress, standing at the forest's edge. Determined expression with a hint of apprehension."

4. Action and Focal Point:
   - Clearly state the main action or focus of the illustration.
   - Example: "Girl taking a brave first step into the shadowy forest, one foot forward."

5. Lighting and Atmosphere:
   - Describe key lighting effects that set the mood.
   - Example: "Contrast between dark forest shadows and a soft glow from the amulet the girl is holding. Dappled light breaking through the canopy."

6. Perspective and Composition:
   - Specify the viewpoint and any important compositional elements.
   - Example: "Wide shot, viewing the scene from a slight angle. Trees loom large, dwarfing the girl."

7. Age-Appropriate Details:

   - For older children, you can include more complex or subtle details.
