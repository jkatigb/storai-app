3. Dialogue: Use quotation marks for spoken words and attribute dialogue to specific characters.
4. Descriptive Language: Use vivid, sensory language to complement the image without being redundant.

1. Character Continuity: Are characters consistently represented in appearance and personality?
2. Setting Continuity: Does the setting align with previous descriptions and the overall world of the story?
3. Style Consistency: Does the described art style match the established style for the book?
4. Age Appropriateness: Is the content suitable for the target age range in both complexity and subject matter?
5. Thematic Alignment: Does the page contribute to the overall themes and moral of the story?
