   - Ensure challenges and resolutions are understandable and relatable for young readers.

7. Illustration Opportunities:
   - Note potential moments or scenes that would make for engaging illustrations.
   - Consider visual variety in these moments (e.g., action scenes, emotional moments, beautiful settings).

## Consistency Checks

Before finalizing the enhanced outline, verify:

1. Narrative Flow: Does each section logically lead to the next?
2. Character Consistency: Are characters' actions and growth consistent with their established traits?

2. Offers clear guidance for the full story development process.
3. Balances plot progression, character development, and theme exploration.
4. Provides ample opportunities for engaging illustrations.
5. Remains true to the original story parameters and intentions.

5. FallingAction:
   - Milo successfully helps Sammy, and they retrieve the Golden Acorn. Milo realizes that courage isn't about not being afraid, but about doing things even when you are scared.

6. Resolution:
